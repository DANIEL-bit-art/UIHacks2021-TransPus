## How TransPus works
- The commuters will register on the app with their details. 
- The drivers also will register on the app with their details which must include the plate number and must be verified by their coordinating body before approval of their registration.
- Google maps and locations will be incorporated into the design of the app which helps the commuters to connect with other commuters in the same axis and also sends a signal to a nearby driver through the TransPus app.
