# TransPus
An App that helps tackle the inadequate access to transportation in remote areas in the University of Ibadan campus environment.

## Problem TransPus Solves
- Drivers not identifying areas where stranded commuters are easily.
- Inadequate access to transport in remote areas in University of Ibadan.

## Solution
- TransPus is an app that can connects commuters in locations within the same axis and also alerts the drivers of the public transport of the commuters in that location ready for pick up

## Why you should use TransPus
- Easy to use
- Secure and protected
- Inexpensive
- Accessible

## How TransPus works
- The commuters will register on the app with their details. 
- The drivers also will register on the app with their details which must include the plate number and must be verified by their coordinating body before approval of their registration.
- Google maps and locations will be incorporated into the design of the app which helps the commuters to connect with other commuters in the same axis and also sends a signal to a nearby driver through the TransPus app.
